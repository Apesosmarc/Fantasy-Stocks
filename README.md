# Overview
Users can create watchlists and get real time stock data fetched from IEX API. This app saves info based on the user
logged in and fetches the latest news for each stock in the user's watchlist for a custom news feed based on the holdings the user adds.

This front end receives data from multiple API's and stores them in an app level
state that can be accessed by any nested component using Redux. Users can create an account authorized by the Google OAuth API, or log in with a guest account.

Using Redux Forms, I validate inputs on the front end to accept only ticker letter formats and to validate the existance of the company via IEX.
Installed is the Redux Thunk middleware which lets make async requests in action creators before dispatching desired data to the Redux store.

Dark/light mode button changes app theme and user preference gets stored to localStorage. Elements with lengthy styling assigned styles using 
tailwind CSS utility classes to limit Tailwind markup styles. React modals get called for google login screen and delete prompts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
